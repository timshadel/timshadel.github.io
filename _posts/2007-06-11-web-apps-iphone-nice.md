It&#8217;s all over the news today. Steve Jobs announced that there won&#8217;t be an SDK for the iPhone &#8212; just use [Safari][1]. Oh, and you Windows developers can use [Safari for Windows][1] to test out your [iPhone][2] apps. (BTW &#8212; I really love the &#8220;resizable text areas&#8221; in the new Safari 3 beta. It makes working in the web much nicer when you don&#8217;t have to be cramped in a tiny box!)

This seems like an interesting confluence of releases to try to gain further inroads in the market: release a killer OS upgrade ([all for just $129][3]), release a revolutionary phone, and then make sure developers everywhere can test that their webapps will work with it by pushing your browser to that other OS.

We&#8217;ll have to see if these connections play out the way it seems, but I&#8217;m very excited about the announcements today from Apple. I, for one, am planning an app with some iPhone integration so I&#8217;m interested to see how the development goes.
