Odd as it may seem, the wife of one of the guys on my team got hit with some [Exploding Water][1] on Sunday morning. First degree burns on her face; glasses protected her eyes. Didn&#8217;t know nuking water in a Pyrex container could be so volatile under just the right conditions. Guess this gives you an excuse not to scrub your dishes *too* clean. <img src="http://timshadel.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" />
