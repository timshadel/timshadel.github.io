Random tidbit. I&#8217;ve followed [Merlin&#8217;s dangerous precedent][1], and nuked nearly everything I have in my RSS reader. Unlike Merlin, I didn&#8217;t delete everything. I&#8217;ve left only those places I **know** I enjoy reading at least once a week. Everything else is gone. I did, however, backup my subscriptions as an OPML file. I&#8217;ll drop that into my personal Subversion repo, `svn rm` and then forget about it. If I *really, **really*** need it I can dig and the clutter&#8217;s gone from view. But I&#8217;m sure I won&#8217;t need to. If you care at all, you can see my subscriptions on [my public Bloglines profile][2]. In addition to what you see I have [one Trial folder][3], and one folder to ensure my own feeds come out right.
