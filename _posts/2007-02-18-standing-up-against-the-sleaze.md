These days there&#8217;s lots of sleaze around, and one place where it annoys me is at the domain registrar GoDaddy.com. I&#8217;ve used them forever it seems &#8212; back when I saw their ad on AltaVista&#8217;s search engine. These days, though, I find their marketing to be sleazier than I appreciate. On top of that I&#8217;m not interested in paying the rates they require to keep your domain private, and for my new domains I&#8217;m interested in simple email setups and such. So Google Apps for Your Domain fits the bill quite nicely. It&#8217;s $10 per year, you get a GMail-ish setup plus more, and [I don&#8217;t have to use GoDaddy.com][1].

I haven&#8217;t yet signed up with eNom for anything. I plan to purchase my first domain from them (via Google Apps) tomorrow. I may not be able to move all of my domains right away, but I think that by pushing my money to someone else that&#8217;s less offensive I&#8217;ll feel better about what it gets used for in the end. It&#8217;s small, but it&#8217;s one simple way to start standing up against the sleaze of the day.
