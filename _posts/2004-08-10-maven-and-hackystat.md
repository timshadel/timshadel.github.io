My open source work over the next little while is going to involve providing better integration between [Hackystat][1] and [Maven][2]. I&#8217;m excited, since the two tools seem to naturally fit together. Hackystat collects and analyzes data over time. Maven provides an extensible build framework and really good HTML reports of certain build metrics. Bringing the best of the two worlds together will be quite interesting to watch.
