## Balsamiq seems perfect for quick impressions

The bottom line? [Balsamiq][1] is even cooler than it&#8217;s great first impression &#8212; you should use it. Bugs? A few. Do they impact me? Not enough to care. Support? Very good. In short: buy it. It&#8217;s worth it.

## When to use it.

Anytime you want to talk with someone about how something should work. And especially when you&#8217;re comparing it to how something works already.

I&#8217;ve been using Balsamiq for the last several months. When I say that, I also need to give a bit of explanation. You see, it&#8217;s not the kind of application that begs you for daily use. At least not to me. But it&#8217;s the kind of app that just aches to be used at certain key points &#8212; when you need to -communicate- help someone get what you&#8217;re thinking, or when you need to explore that idea that seems just right in your head (Balsamiq will have a way of giving you usable feedback quickly &#8212; maybe you really haven&#8217;t thought things out so well&#8230;), or in a dozen other scenarios that come up.

## Think of it as Test-First UI design.

Don&#8217;t sit down and start hacking out your rhtml, haml, jsp, or whatever. Mock it up first with Balsamiq. I was amazed at how easy it was to get a decent sketch of our existing website with it, and how quickly my team could recognize what I wanted to do to it with before and after sketches. The conversation about what I wanted went like this, &#8220;Here&#8217;s our current site. Can everyone recognize it? Good. So here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m thinking we should do. [5 min conversation about the idea, backend implications, etc] The conversation stayed entirely focused on the idea I was proposing, and wasn&#8217;t distracted by the sketch mechanics.

Balsamiq enabled the conversation in an interesting way. It was a bit different from a whiteboard. I originally thought that I&#8217;d use Balsamiq but worried that whiteboard would be more agile, more practical for the space that I thought this tool was written for. Over a couple months of using this tool, I found that wasn&#8217;t the case. I use the whiteboard all the time still, but I found that the whiteboard isn&#8217;t a tool that helps me think *about* my idea. I&#8217;ve seen more productive conversations around a Balsamiq mockup than around a whiteboard. Whiteboard conversations I&#8217;ve had seem more half-baked now that I have something else to compare them to. I think a lot of that has to do with forethought. Balsamiq hits a sweet spot where you feel like it prods you to think about your idea *just* enough to get it decently clear, but because it looks sketchy you don&#8217;t get lost in the loop of trying to make it just perfect. It&#8217;s enough to have the conversation you want to have.

Try it out and see what kinds of conversations you have with the mockups it generates. It just may surprise you.
