I&#8217;ve been toying with the idea of writing a book lately, and [this][1] set of hacking instructions for [subversion][2]&#8216;s book really got me excited. They describe [DocbookLite][3], the book format used by O&#8217;Reilly.

Perhaps some day I&#8217;ll [write][4] a bit for [O&#8217;Reilly][5].
