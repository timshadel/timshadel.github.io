I&#8217;ve been on the mailing list for [Basecamp][1] for a year, and I&#8217;ve never tried it out. They recently sent an email about [a free todo list][2] web application based on their Basecamp site. I tried out the todo list, and decided it was worth setting up a simple project with their free Basecamp profile.

So far, it looks promising. I like the fact that they charge per project and not per person. I also like that they allow you to export the project milestones in iCal format. My wife uses a Mac, and I use a PC with Firefox browser on either Linux or Windows.
