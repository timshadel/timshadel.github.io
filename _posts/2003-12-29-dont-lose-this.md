After reading [Phil Windley][1]&#8216;s [post][2] about login.utah.gov, I wanted to check it out for myself. We&#8217;ve just finished a structure to users affiliated with the ASRS to register and login to future applications, and I was interested in the state-wide direction that Utah has taken.

In doing so, I stumbled across [this][3] site that is a pretty cool collection of the Utah state developers&#8217; common practices, tools, and such. I&#8217;d like to keep watching it.
