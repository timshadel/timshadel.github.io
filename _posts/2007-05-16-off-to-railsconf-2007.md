In a couple hours I&#8217;ll be catching a plane to Portland to [attend RailsConf 2007][1]. I&#8217;m stoked to hear the presentations, and talk to others that are using Rails every day. It&#8217;s gonna be a great Ruby feast, to be sure.

If you want to meet up, contact me through [my website][2] or just look for anyone wearing a [CodeSmack t-shirt][3]. Chances are good on the first day that it&#8217;s me. We&#8217;ll have some for sale, so if you wait until Saturday your chances of finding me solely by the t-shirt will be diminished. <img src="http://timshadel.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" />

I&#8217;ll be updating [my RailsConf schedule][4] this afternoon and tonight. I&#8217;ll try to keep it current during the conference as well. Hope to see you there!
