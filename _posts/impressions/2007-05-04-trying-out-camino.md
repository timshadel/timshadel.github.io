I&#8217;ve been using Firefox for a long time. Last night I decided to give [Camino][1] a spin. I&#8217;m using a nightly build of what [will become the 1.5 stable release][2] later this month. This thing sings. It&#8217;s fast, feels lean and light, and it stores my passwords in [Apple&#8217;s Keychain][3]. Lovely.

There&#8217;s no way I can give up [Firefox][4] for development &#8212; [Firebug][5] is just too cool. I may, however, use Camino for normal &#8220;work&#8221; where I&#8217;m not trying to tweak the CSS, layout, or whatever of something I&#8217;m actually building. This dichotomy could perhaps become too burdensome; though I think [QuickSilver][6] will surely see to most of that concern. I could discover that I insanely miss the occasional GreaseMonkey thing, or I really miss&#8230;something. We&#8217;ll see. For now, I&#8217;m happy to have a zippy browser again.
