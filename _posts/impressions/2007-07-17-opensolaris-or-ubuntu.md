Back at RailsConf a couple months ago, there were a few presentations that made an interesting case for considering OpenSolaris instead of Linux. I had never really considered Solaris much before then. When we got back, one of my friends, [Preston Lee][1], really wanted to dig into it to find out more. He got a buddy that&#8217;s a Ph.D. candidate to put his research hat on and [compare OpenSolaris ZFS vs. Linux ext3 RAID5][2].

What do you think of the results? I know I&#8217;ve said that [Mac beats Ubuntu hands down][3] for the desktop, but I still love Ubuntu on the server side (and I know a [great Ubuntu sysadmin][4]). Is anyone using OpenSolaris? I&#8217;m all for gathering opinions on this topic. Leave a comment and let us know!
