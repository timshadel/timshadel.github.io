When I first thought of getting and iPhone I never figured I&#8217;d use the video feature much. But it turns out that I was wrong.

![My iPhone item count][1]

I&#8217;ve found that things like [Railscasts][2] are both incredibly useful, and surprisingly readable on the 160 dpi screen. I&#8217;ve also just loaded up the [Apple Video Tips][3] to check them out.

These short kinds of video tutorials are great for short waits, and I like the way that video can illustrate the point quickly.

Oh &#8212; and having a kids movie like Finding Nemo on there can really help out when you end up waiting WAY longer than you expected somewhere JUST before nap time&#8230; <img src="http://timshadel.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" />

Just one more way the iPhone has really changed the way I do many things &#8212; for the better.
