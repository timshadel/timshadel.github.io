[Merant VM web client: VM web client Project Databases][1]

Granted, you have to call their sales group to get a login to this demo, but obviously people aren&#8217;t beating down their door. I&#8217;ve got a long list of gripes with PVCS Version Manager [7.5.1.0 (Build 297) to be exact]. Not the least of which is a woefully inadequate branching and merging model. Their [sales docs][2] and [data sheet][2] don&#8217;t seem to hint that much has changed. Though, at this link they say

[Merant Version Manager &#8211; automates common team development tasks, protects code for safe reuse and parallel development, and prevents lost changes and content errors][3]

> **More than source code protection**
>
> Merant Version Manager enables and automates complex team tasks such as parallel development, visual differencing, branching and merging, identification of merge conflicts, promotion levels and team workflow.</p>
Even the long title (taken directly from the web page) leaves a bad impression of pure sales jargon or a blatant attempt at a high search rank.

I&#8217;ll leave my technical beef with PVCS for another post.
