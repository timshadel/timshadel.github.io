My two year old just blasted past between my laptop and the plug. The mag adapter dropped off my MacBook Pro in silent fashion. My two year old kept quietly running (a rare thing &#8212; the quiet part). I was happy. It&#8217;s the tiny details like this where design shows its true colors. Is your app built for your users&#8217; reality? Do your programmers need a reality check? How many &#8220;two year old&#8221; problems exist in their workspace, that you should handle beautifully instead of try to put those problems in a straight jacket?
