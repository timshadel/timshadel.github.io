Yes, it&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve moderated my comments, and there was an abundance of spam. I didn&#8217;t read any of it, but in skimming for the stray real comment my eye caught on one spam message that began:

> Your site is very cognitive. I think you have a good future. <img src="http://timshadel.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" />

It still baffles me that such comments could be substance enough to dup readers into clicking their links It wastes of time, so I just deleted all unmoderated comments (sorry if you had a real one). In any case, suffice it to say that I&#8217;ve returned to the blogging world after a couple months&#8217; hiatus, and I&#8217;m glad to know that my site is &#8220;very cognitive&#8221;.
