In my own personal ups and downs to hit <a href="http://inboxzero.com/" title="Merlin Mann's excellent InboxZero" target="_blank">InboxZero</a> every day, I find that the silly tool that helps me the most is having a keystroke to move the current email into an Archive folder.

I used to use <a href="http://www.hawkwings.net/2005/10/21/getting-things-done-in-apple-mail/" title="Getting Things Done in Apple Mail" target="_blank"><em>Mail-Act-On</em></a>, but was too cheap to pay for it. Now, in *Mail.app* of <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/" title="OS X Lion" target="_blank">OS X Lion</a>, it&#8217;s dead simple to do, no extra purchase required. Lion&#8217;s copy of mail now has an `Archive` button that will create an Archive folder if it doesn&#8217;t exist already, and then move the current message there. Here&#8217;s how to get a shortcut key assigned to it:

First, open up *System Preferences*.

Next, go into the `Keyboard PrefPane`. Select the `Keyboard Shortcuts` tab near the top.

Now select `Application Shortcuts` in the left column, and then click the `'+'` sign at the bottom of the right-hand column to add a new application keyboard shortcut. In the top drop down box, choose `Mail`.

Now these keyboard shortcuts rely upon selecting an exact menu item from the application. So here&#8217;s what the `Message menu` looks like in *Mail.app*:

[<img src="http://timshadel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/MailArchiveMenuItem.png" alt="" title="Mail Archive Menu Item" width="319" height="425" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-363" />][4]

There are two things to notice: first, there&#8217;s no shortcut listed on the right-hand side, and second, the menu item text we need is simply `Archive`. So now we&#8217;ll go back to the `Keyboard PrefPane` and type that into the `Menu Title text box`. Next click into the `Keyboard Shortcut text box` and type in your preferred shortcut key. I used `Ctrl + A`, which is displayed as `^A`.

Finally, switch back to *Mail.app* and check out the `Messages menu` again. The `Archive menu item` now shows your keyboard shortcut key on the right hand side.

[<img src="http://timshadel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/MailArchiveMenuWithShortcut.png" alt="" title="Mail Archive Menu With Shortcut" width="319" height="425" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-364" />][6]

Now take it for a test drive: select an email you&#8217;d like to archive and then hit your shortcut (`^A` for me). You should see your email safely disappear into your Archive folder. And for bonus points, if you have more than one email account, select two emails sent to **different accounts**. When you hit your shortcut key to archive them, each will go to the correct account&#8217;s Archive folder. Booyah!

With that set, I can fly through my Inbox deleting and archiving as fast as possible, leaving behind only the emails that I really have to think about and extract meaning from.

Processing email on my iPhone is just a losing battle after having this setup. Now go on. Get going on it. You&#8217;ll feel like a ninja.
