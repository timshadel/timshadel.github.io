One of the great things about living and working in Phoenix is the weather in November. All the books say hiking season is October &#8211; April, and they&#8217;re right. The company picnic was planned for today, but it&#8217;s been cancelled since it&#8217;s predicted to rain all day. I don&#8217;t recall a rainy day this month (but I rarely pay attention to the weather), but it&#8217;s a bit funny to me to have something cancelled due to threat of rain in November. Very different from when I lived in Vermont. <img src="http://timshadel.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" />
