One of the things I&#8217;ve done to clean things up as I&#8217;ve been dusting the cobwebs off my blog, is to move all of my MP3 content to archive.org and explicitly license it under one of the Creative Commons licenses. When I did that, they even created a [landing page][1] for my content. Kinda cool. What this really means to listeners is that&#8230;well, no. It doest really mean anything to listeners. My server has a pretty decent connection right now, but downloads may be a bit faster. All of the URLs are still pointing to my domain, and I intend to leave it that way. If you&#8217;ve got content you want to share, consider putting it there; it&#8217;s free. <img src="http://timshadel.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" />
