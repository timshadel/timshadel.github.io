I setup a Campfire account for my RailsConf 2007 visit. Guest access is on, so come on over. It&#8217;s a <del datetime="2007-05-17T16:00:13+00:00">free</del> basic account now, but if more people come I&#8217;ll try to upgrade it as needed (if it gets *big* I&#8217;ll post a donation link). So come on by and chat.
