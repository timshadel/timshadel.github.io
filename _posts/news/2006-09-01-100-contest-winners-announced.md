Yeah. I&#8217;m way behind the times here, but [Peter][1] from the [Ruby Inside][2] blog [announced][3] the [$100 Ruby Blogging Contest][4] winners last week. And I got lucky enough to win the $15 second prize. True to his word, a little PayPal message came floating my way not long afterward. Thanks Peter!

I think the real value of this contest, though, is the wealth of [great Ruby articles][5] that it generated. Just take a look at all the finalists. Congrats to [Duncan Beevers][6] for winning the $100 prize with his article [Using Simile Timeline with Ruby on Rails Views][7].
