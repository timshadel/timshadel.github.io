OK. I&#8217;ve gone from [MoveableType][1] to [Blogger][2] to [Blosxom][3] to [Pebble][4], back to Blogger, and now to [WordPress][5]. I&#8217;m impressed with the interface. It&#8217;s much easier to work with than most other systems I&#8217;ve been on.

I&#8217;ve tried to structure the permalinks so that they&#8217;re easy to port to another system later on. I&#8217;ve eliminated the dates from them altogether. I figure I&#8217;d prefer to make my titles unique anyway, and you shouldn&#8217;t have to know the date of a post to link to it. Let me know if you&#8217;d like to see it differently.

So my next set of work is to bring all my old posts in. I&#8217;ve never caught any of my blogs up to date yet, so cross your fingers. I just might do it.

**UPDATE:** I&#8217;ve changed my permalink structure back to the traditional /archives/year/month/day format since it had some unexpected side effects. My calendar no longer had valid links for day summaries, and I really want that. I just supposed (naively, I guess) that archive links to months and days would always force a date structure on the URL but the truly permanent link could be constructed without any date information using a purely unique identifier. Maybe I&#8217;ve just been staring a [Russel Beattie][6]&#8216;s permalinks too long.
