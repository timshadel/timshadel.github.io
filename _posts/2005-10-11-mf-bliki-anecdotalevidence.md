I&#8217;ve had my head down on a project for the last few months â€” thus the silence. Martin Fowler&#8217;s recent note about Anecdotal Evidence brought me out of it.

> Some people would extend this &#8211; saying you can&#8217;t really talk about an idea until you&#8217;ve seen it on multiple projects. While this is nice, I don&#8217;t agree that it&#8217;s necessary. Just reporting on one particular thing you discovered on a project is useful because it provides raw material for others. Someone else might be in a similar position and your idea gives them something to try. Someone else may have done a similar thing and when they write about their experiences they report theirs on top of yours.

I&#8217;ve always been a bit hesitant to share stuff I&#8217;m in the middle of doing. Revisions throughout the process often make the end result quite different from where I started. Instead of holding back until I&#8217;ve found something I like, I&#8217;ll start talking about stuff I&#8217;m in the middle of. Hopefully you&#8217;ll help me out as you have advice for me to take.
