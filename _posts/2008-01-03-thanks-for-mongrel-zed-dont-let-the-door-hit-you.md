I&#8217;m not sad to see the writer of Mongrel leave. Not one bit. I&#8217;m not sure what [Dave Thomas][1] [was reading][2] [earlier today][2], but I don&#8217;t have anything positive to say about it.

I like Mongrel. I&#8217;ve read Zed Shaw&#8217;s <del datetime="2008-01-03T06:13:58+00:00">article</del> rant on programmers and statistics, and I liked it quite a bit &#8212; though I prefer his [Ruby/Odeum vs. Lucene Analysis Part 2][3] since it lays out a more clear example of his opinion about how to properly use statistics to analyze software (amazing &#8212; Zed can make a set of useful points without using the F-word!!).

But as an outsider to whatever caused his Rails rant, he just doesn&#8217;t come off as credible when he makes <del>silly</del> <del>pointless</del> <del>wildly</del> exaggerated claims about his skills and situation and then <del>begs</del> <del>dares</del> <del>challenges</del> asks anyone disagreeing with him (except *Humility*) to start an all out fist fight.

<!--more-->

I wouldn&#8217;t hire him. And I don&#8217;t think many people would if he behaves on the job anything like he does on his blog. I&#8217;m sure he thinks that&#8217;s too bad for me. And I&#8217;m glad that we&#8217;re both happy with the result. Consequently, I think we&#8217;re both quite fine with his decision to leave the Ruby/Rails community for good.

In the end, it just doesn&#8217;t matter. He&#8217;s only sorta known compared to the heavy hitters (when I said Zed Shaw, a number of people said &#8220;Who?&#8221; and then I had to tell them &#8220;the guy that wrote Mongrel&#8221; &#8212; evidence of the error of his <del>delusions</del> perceptions of his own fame). We&#8217;ll mourn his natural-self-selection out of the Ruby ecosystem, remember Darwin&#8217;s theories of natural selection, and then dry our tears and watch smarter, happier, funnier people blossom in the space he used to fill.

So Zed, I don&#8217;t hate you. I simply know we&#8217;ll be just fine ignoring you. And please don&#8217;t let the door hit you on the way out.
