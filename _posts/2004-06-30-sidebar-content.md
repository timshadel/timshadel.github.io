I&#8217;ve played with [Furl.net&#8217;s Site Integration][1] and I&#8217;ve begun to wonder if there&#8217;s other content that&#8217;s useful in a sidebar. For example, could I take an RSS feed like [CodeHaus issues submitted by me][2] and turn it into a sidebar? Could I merge that with [JIRA issues I&#8217;ve submitted][3] and others to get a full watch list across several distributed systems? If so, I&#8217;m sure I could also do the same for open issues assigned to me. What about Confluence posts, and perhaps Subversion or CVS commits? Would it be beneficial? Interesting questions.
