I&#8217;m waiting in line for Harry Potter 7 now. There are more fake British accents than I&#8217;ve heard in a while. Definitely a few hundred people here from kids in strollers to a man I dress military garb. The costume contest is packed with Hermione entries but slim on Harry and Ron entries. I&#8217;m not the costume type, but after I finish this post I&#8217;m gonna flip my iPhone around and watch the fourth movie until I get my copy of the Deathly Hallows and head back to read with my wife. After following the series for so many years it&#8217;s amazing that this day has finally arrived.

It&#8217;ll pass and I&#8217;ll be back to technical books in no time. But for now I&#8217;m a fan of something that doesn&#8217;t involve a processor. <img src="http://timshadel.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" />
