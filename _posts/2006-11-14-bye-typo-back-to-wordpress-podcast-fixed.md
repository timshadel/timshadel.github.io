OK. Now that the little one&#8217;s affording me a bit more sleep, I&#8217;ve finally gotten around to fixing my podcast. I took the cheap way out &#8212; I simply moved back to WordPress. I didn&#8217;t find that my experience with Typo was all that compelling. I had to rework my permalinks, migrate the content (comments didn&#8217;t come over well), and then there was the question of the podcast (it totally didn&#8217;t work at all &#8212; all the content&#8217;s actually at archive.org).

So now I&#8217;ve fixed it all up and hopefully the stage is now set for smoother sailing on both the blog and the podcast from here on out.
