The month of September has flown by, and I&#8217;ve had my hands covered with Ruby work of late. In the process, I&#8217;ve needed to tweak some great projects like [Starling][1], [Webistrano][2] and [xmpp4r-simple][3]. These projects are definitely maturing, and it&#8217;s been great to get under the hood to see how they tick, and see where I can help nudge them in the direction I hope to see them move.

Drop me a line and let me know what you&#8217;re up to. Better yet, shoot me your github.com profile link, so I can follow you. You can keep track of me on [my GitHub profile][4] as well.

Happy Coding!
