> Alternatively, if you&#8217;re taking a laptop, you can have Pebble up and running on Tomcat in 5 minutes. 

From [Simon Brown&#8217;s][1] [JavaOne tips][2] got me thinking. I could use [Pebble][3] to edit my blog anywhere, and use [Subversion][4] to keep it syncrhonized. I think it would work. All the config and data files for Pebble are text (XML), and they all live in one directory hierarchy. I can use a local installation of Pebble on my laptop, at work, and at home. I can use Subversion to keep them in sync, and ultimately decide when a group of edits goes to my public blog site. Perhaps I&#8217;ll try it.

It seems like [Dave][5] and [Andy][6] do this, but they edit the source files directly. I know that [bloxsom][7] [supposedly supoports][8] using Subversion, but I never got it to work. Blosxom uses files as well, but Pebble vs. blosxom is meat for another post.
