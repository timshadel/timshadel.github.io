[Ruby][1] has been a growing blip on my radar for a while. In this show I describe my first real production Ruby application at work &#8212; and it&#8217;s small enough to talk about a few details. I cover how we use Ruby to automate some interactions with [Subversion][2] and [Maven][3]. I&#8217;ve done some [Rails][4] stuff too, but that&#8217;s a whole different topic. Conclusion: Ruby should be something you use to complement Java. If you want a Ruby vs. Java fight, you won&#8217;t find it here.

Some great resources metioned in the pocast are [Programming Ruby][5] and [Agile Web Development with Rails][6].
