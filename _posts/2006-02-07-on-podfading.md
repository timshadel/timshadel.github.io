Merlin Mann has an interesting take on podcasting here:

[Flash: “Podfading” ravages the landscape of logorrheic bloggers][1]

> Me? I like the idea that a podcast is simply another way to post. Nothing more. Same way that Flickr and del.icio.us — to name just a couple — let me share something in a way that isn’t a traditional blog post, recording audio lets me (try to) make a certain point in my own way and with tone (and, one hopes, personality) that are a contrast with typically dry blog writing. But maybe that’s just me.

Agreed. 100%. I view the Zdot podcast as [an extension of my blog][2]. It lets me speak about things I&#8217;d rather speak about, and write about things I&#8217;d rather write about. My frequency isn&#8217;t tied to a radio show paradigm, but to my interests. It seems this works well for most of my listeners, too.
