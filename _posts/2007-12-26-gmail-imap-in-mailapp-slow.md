![GMail IMAP downloading at 1.1 KB/s][1]

I never download anything in Safari this slow. It&#8217;s easily hundreds of times faster. It&#8217;s been well over a month since I setup my GMail IMAP. I&#8217;ve done some [initial investigation][2], but nothing concrete showed up that I hadn&#8217;t tried. Any ideas?
