I think it would be really cool to have a set of personal analysis patterns
that I could choose from when creating applications. These could include
solutions I&#8217;ve found helpful for:

  * Build systems
  * Payment tracking
  * Email generation
  * Project management

They should be searchable, and perhaps include UML designs.
