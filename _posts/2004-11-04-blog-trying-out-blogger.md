After being thoroughly frustrated with the inability of my hosting service to handle the traffic that my Eclipse post generated, I&#8217;m trying out Blogger. I had an account here way back, but wanted more features and better control. They updated their site a while ago, but I was in the midst of my own blog hosting. Now I&#8217;m back to check it out.
