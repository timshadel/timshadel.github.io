> This was not because the package was that complex, but because each person in the line thought they were going to be paying $25 per person. In reality, the tribe was charging another $50 on top of the $25 for each person. You read that right, 75 bucks a pop. The &#8220;Question Answerer&#8221; explained it to us:

When I heard about the glass skywalk it sounded like a really cool idea in principle. Now that I read this, I&#8217;m definitely passing on the trip for a LONG time. **No cameras** on the skywalk (what!!??!), long lines, and hidden fees. $75 per person is not even thinkable. No way. Too bad they launched in the day where one guy&#8217;s blog post can touch a few thousand potential customers.
