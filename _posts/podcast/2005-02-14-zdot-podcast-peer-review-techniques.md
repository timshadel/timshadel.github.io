Download [A Survey of Peer Review Techniques.][1]

This week we&#8217;re looking at peer reviews.

#### Show Notes

Today&#8217;s podcast brushes over several techniques described by Karl Wiegers and Steve McConnell, including:

  * inspections
  * team reviews
  * walkthroughs
  * pair programming
  * code reading
  * dog and pony shows or client demos
  * peer deskchecks or pass-arounds
  * ad hoc reviews

There were two major sources for this podcast. First is the article [When Two Eyes Aren&#8217;t Enough][2], by Karl Wiegers and available from his website, [processimpact.com][3]. The second was Chapter 21 of Steve McConnell&#8217;s second edition of [Code Complete][4].
