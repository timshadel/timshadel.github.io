In part two of my series of podcasts on why I&#8217;m not interested in using JSF in the future, I focus on the Leaky Abstraction that it provides. I feel like the leaks get in the way of getting actual work done; they confuse new developers, and cause headaches for everyone. Users even see the results of the leaking.

Some of the leaks I discuss include:

  * Ultimately, JSF provides a [Leaky Abstraction][1] that (in spite of its promise) still requires all developers to understand Request-Response in addition to the 6 lifecycle phases.
  * Security in the web.xml is based around URL, and by definition you don&#8217;t know the URL for many JSF actions. This makes it MUCH harder to get the fine-grained security right, but also expose the basic servlet (think Request-Response) nature of the application.
  * Users may refresh a page, like the Search Results, and be whirled away to the search entry page &#8211; their results having been scattered to the wind.

My point isn&#8217;t that these items can&#8217;t be dealt with, but that the core abstraction leaks somewhat and I prefer to do without it. I have *many* choices of Java web frameworks. I&#8217;d rather be solving the business problems &#8211; those are by far more important. Please see previous posts [here][2] and [here][3].

**UPDATE:**[The third and final part][4] of the series is now posted.
