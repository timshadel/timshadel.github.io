Our team has used JSF for the better part of a year. My vote: skip it. Check out the first of a long list of reasons why the JSF 7-layer burrito won&#8217;t be on my round for seconds.

In this podcast, I stick close to our experiences with JSF as a team, and my opinions on it. If you&#8217;d like to read stuff others have read about it, a [couple][1] [searches][2] should put you smack in the middle of a debate.

If you&#8217;re looking for information on the REST architecture I talked about in the podcast, you can get the [short version from a third party][3], or the [original dissertation from Roy Fielding][4].

**UPDATE:** This page has been read more than twice my average (though the number of podcast downloads are still normal &#8212; is anyone new actually listening?). In anticipation of more podcast episodes to come, I&#8217;ve [posted a more complete list][5] of the things that made be decide I&#8217;d like to avoid JSF in the future.

**UPDATE 2:** [Part two][6] of the series is now posted.

**FINAL UPDATE:**[The third and final part][7] of the series is now posted.
