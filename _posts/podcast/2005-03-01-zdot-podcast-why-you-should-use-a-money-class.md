Download [Why You Should Use a Money Class][1].

This week is focused on some of the business constructs useful in your code.

#### Show Notes

Most of the ideas from today&#8217;s show came from the following sources:

  * Martin Fowler&#8217;s [Money Class][2] from [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture][3]
  * The [IEEE Software][4] article [When to Make a Type][5], by Martin Fowler
  * UPDATE: I found some [sample code for a Money class][6], by <del>some guy</del> Jody Garnett (<del>can&#8217;t find it on Google again, I&#8217;ll update it later</del> I finally found it on archive.org)
  * IBM&#8217;s [BigDecimal implementation][7], their [JSR][8], and it&#8217;s [inclusion in JDK 1.5][9]
