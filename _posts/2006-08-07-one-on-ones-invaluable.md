I&#8217;ve just started one on one meetings with my new team. I&#8217;ve read about them in [Behind Closed Doors][1], and I&#8217;ve [seen][2] [the][3] [success][4] that [Ed Gibbs][5] [has had][6] with them, so I finally decided to jump in. I did the first round a couple weeks ago, and then got to &#8220;busy&#8221; to keep them up. Today, I got back on track and setup a recurring meeting. Already I feel more energized about where we&#8217;re at. It sounds kinda cliche, but I really feel like I have a deeper insight into the motivations of each developer. I get more detailed suggestions about development practices, clearer reports of code problems, and insight into where the perceive the biggest challenges are for their work or for the team.

When I meet with the team members one on one, I really feel like I&#8217;m better equipped to help them out instead of blindly give directions or simply get in the way. I think after even just short exposure to one on one meetings, I&#8217;m sold.

One thing I&#8217;ve found helpful: turn off your monitor. I&#8217;m also investigating how to forward my phone directly to voicemail.
