I love to find examples of small details around the web that impress me in their innovation, craftsmanship, beauty, or structure. Here&#8217;s one I ran across last week:

[<img src="http://timshadel.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/MobileMe-Forgot-Password-e1291052410874.png" alt="" title="MobileMe Forgot Password" width="589" height="385" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-313" />][1]

When you type in a bad password on [MobileMe][2], it doesn&#8217;t simply show an error dialog, but animates in a bubble that points to the password box and hovers over the existing text. This is a nice departure from error messages that insert themselves into the 2D HTML layout that&#8217;s typical of most websites.

This provides that modern feel through layering, shadows, and animation that make it feel like the iPhone &#8212; human in its approach to UI interactions with you. All the subtle cues are there, and all the mechanisms to help you adjust to the new layout naturally. I really like it.

I captured and annotated this screenshot using [Awesome Screenshot][3] ([available for Safari][4], and [Chrome][5]). I like to grab screenshots with it, and then annotate them with text and arrows, then drop them into [Evernote][6] and let it index the text it sees inside the image. That way I get notes close to the things I care about, I can point instead of say &#8220;that box up above the blue one&#8221;, and I don&#8217;t lose the benefits of searching my notes. Overall it&#8217;s a pretty effective way for me to take notes about designs I like around the web.

I think I&#8217;ll try to snag an example or two each week for a while and post them here in my [Impressions][7] area to share with you.
