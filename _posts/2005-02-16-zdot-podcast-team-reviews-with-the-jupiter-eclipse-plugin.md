Download [Team Reviews and Intro to Jupiter Plugin][1].

This week we&#8217;re looking at peer reviews.

#### Show Notes

This show discusses how we use the Team Review technique talked about in the last show, how I&#8217;ve seen it done, and touches on how the Jupiter plugin supports those efforts.

There a few resources mentioned in this podcast. First is the article [When Two Eyes Aren&#8217;t Enough][2], by Karl Wiegers that we touched on last time. The next is the [CSDL code review standards document][3] that we used as a model to create our own internal code review standards. The last resource is the list of code review tools:

  * [Jupiter Eclipse Plugin][4] [Open Source]. In my view this is **by far** the best tool available. The downsides: it&#8217;s only available for Eclipse. See the [user manual][5].
  * Others listed in [an article from IEEE Software][6] (subscription required). 
      * [BugZilla][7] with patch view extension [Open Source]
      * [CodeStriker][8] [Open Source]
      * [CodeReview][9] for VisualStudio.Net [Commercial]
      * [CodeReviewer][10] [Commercial]
      * [ReviewPro][11] [Commercial]

Here&#8217;s the outline I worked from during the show.

  * Attributes of Team Reviews 
      * Planned, structured; but less formal 
      * Review material ahead of time 
      * Meeting 
      * Basic follow-up, sometimes omitted 
      * Collect data 
      * Often author lead discussion 

  * Ways to make it work 
      * Keep time investment small &#8212; Basic group interaction stuff 
          * Email 
          * Groupwise Appointment 
          * Links at the bottom 
          * What you&#8217;ve got questions about 
      * Keep it simple 
          * Use a simple tool, instead of paper 
          * Keep the focus right (defects vs. knowledge sharing vs. design exploration) 
      * Review standard procedures 
          * Decide on them once 
          * Link to them from the announcement e-mail 

  * Jupiter Plugin Overview 
      * Eclipse plugin 
      * Individual, Team, and Rework phases 
      * Captures data on resolutions and such 
      * Keeps line numbers and files, makes it easy to run through list during review 
      * Data kept in source control, so it&#8217;s convenient
