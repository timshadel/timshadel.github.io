This is kinda cool, since I prefer to work with sites that focus their HTML design around their information. This site&#8217;s HTML is obviously designed by WordPress (for the most part). But it has some of the same elements of information design that are discussed in [Mark Pilgrim&#8217;s][2] [Dive Into Accessibility][3].

In many respects, the concept is simple. Your content should be straight forward, and use decent structural techniques to house your data (


### &#8216;s,

&#8216;s, etc), and your stylish things (layout, colors, fonts, etc) should be injected by CSS. Turning off your CSS can help you see that. Turning off everyone&#8217;s CSS helps you see how others do it. You don&#8217;t just need to wait for one day a year to do this, though. You can use the [Firefox WebDeveloper][4] toolbar to disable CSS on any site you go to. [Read more][5] [about CSS][6] and [web standards][7].
