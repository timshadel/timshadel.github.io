I like to challenge barriers. I think part of it is that I&#8217;ve had so many of my own challenged and under scrutiny, they fell. That opened up worlds hitherto unexplored.

Design is like that. Many people hold to current limitations or artificial constraints that bolster the status quo. Challenging those assumptions almost always leads to greater knowledge. Either I learn something about the system that I didn&#8217;t know. Or new vistas open up and widen our range of viable design options.

True knowledge engenders design freedom.
