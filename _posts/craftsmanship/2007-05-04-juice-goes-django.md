[Kaizen and Juice 2.0 &#8211; Juice Analytics][1]

> We built the new site using Python and Django.

I really like the [Juice Analytics][2] blog. These guys know their stuff when it comes to business analytics and data information display. They know all the big names, all the new tools, and they&#8217;ve got their own tips on top of that which makes it a great read. I really like their new site layout, and find it interesting they went with [Python][3] and [Django][4]. Most of my new stuff these days is Rails, but I have respect for anyone that makes a conscious decision about what they&#8217;ll use. And today, there&#8217;s a lot of power in light languages combined with flexible frameworks. Rock on, Juice.
