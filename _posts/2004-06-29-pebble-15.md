I&#8217;ve just tried to checkout Pebble&#8217;s source, and build the evolving version of 1.5. I couldn&#8217;t do it. There weren&#8217;t any instructions on building that I saw, so I tried a few things.

  * Run the setenv.bat file. This seemed to mess up my `ANT_HOME`.
  * Run `ant -projecthelp`. This gave me a `NullPointerException`.
  * Run `ant`. This gives me `TagUnitTask cannot be found`.

I don&#8217;t have the time or energy to dig in and figure out how the build system works, so for now I&#8217;ll wait. It&#8217;s hard to have all of the [Prime Directives][1] right all of the time.
