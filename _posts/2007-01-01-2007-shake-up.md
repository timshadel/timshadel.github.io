For 2007, I&#8217;ve decided to make a few subtle changes to the way I blog and
podcast.

  1. Less Java, more other stuff.
  2. Less rigor, more direct.
  3. More personal.

**Less Java, more other stuff.** I don&#8217;t find that Java captures my main set
of interests any more. I&#8217;m going to talk more broadly in both my blog and
the Zdot podcast.

**Less rigor, more direct.** Up to this point I&#8217;ve typically waited to post most substantial things until I&#8217;ve had some longer experience. Bloggers like [Matt Raible][1] and [Ed Gibbs][2] write more stream-of-conscious style. I like the feel it brings, so we&#8217;ll see if it fits me in 2007. So don&#8217;t be surprised to see posts that reflect my emotions in the moment.

**More personal.** I&#8217;ve avoided most discussion of the more personal sides of life. I&#8217;m gonna dabble with extending that a bit more.

While this may not mean big changes for you, I think it&#8217;ll free up a few constraints that I&#8217;ve put on myself. So out with the old, and in with the new. I&#8217;ll talk to you soon.
