I&#8217;ve had an iPhone for a while. I&#8217;ve had 3 of the 4 versions, actually. I&#8217;m trying something with the folders introduced back in iOS 4: I put **every** app into a folder, even Phone and Safari. Yeah, it&#8217;s a bit weird, I think. But it&#8217;s forced a new mental process that I like so far.

I have to think about why I unlocked my phone.

Before I&#8217;d grab my phone to look up a phone number and scan my email instead. I&#8217;d need to check my bank account and find I&#8217;d be surfing the stats of Waterlogged usage for the day. All good stuff. None of it what I intended.

So I put together folders, not by topic, but by verb. I now have to say to myself, I want to *look up* a contact so I can send it to John.

Amazingly, my apps can all fit on two iPhone screens, or a single iPad screen. I haven&#8217;t used the search screen to find an app, and I haven&#8217;t needed to check multiple folders to find the app I wanted. So far, it&#8217;s worked way better for me than &#8220;this screen is for games, and this screen is for productivity&#8221; ever did before. <img src="http://timshadel.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" />

How do you organize your iPhone apps?
