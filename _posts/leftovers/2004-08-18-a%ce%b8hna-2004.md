I had never seen the Greek spelling of *Athens* before the Opening Ceremony for the [2004 Summer Olympic Games][1]. I thought it was quite cool. There&#8217;s not much that Americans encounter on a daily basis that gives us a sense of the truly international community we live in. Open source projects do that for me. So did living in a few [non-English speaking][2] countries in Europe (that&#8217;s another reason I like the Olympics — I get to *hear* French, and not just read it). I think experiences that remind us of the world community are perhaps too undervalued in America. Respecting those moments and pondering their significance could truly change the international &#8220;social skills&#8221; of an entire nation, and might even help change the world. Thanks [Αθήνα][3]. You&#8217;ve done well.
