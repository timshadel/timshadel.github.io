With 19 GB of bandwidth served in just 20 days (thanks for listening to my podcast, everyone), I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;ve switched providers. I converted my site over to the new ISP at the beginning of the month, and things have gone quite well. I&#8217;ve got a new WordPress installation (that I absolutely LOVE), my old blog entries are all in (except a few from mid 2003 that I lost along the way), and I&#8217;ve switched from categories to tags. For more on the discussion of why tags are great, see [this post][1] and others by him. Still to come: a better look and feel, and integration with my Furl, del.icio.us, and Flickr stuff.
