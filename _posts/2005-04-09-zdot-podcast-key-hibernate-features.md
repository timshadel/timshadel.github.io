Download [Key Hibernate Features][1].

This show wraps up the intro to [Hibernate][2] with a discussion of some of its key features including directly using POJOs, detaching objects from a Session, lazy loading, using Hibernate&#8217;s &#8220;user types&#8221; to map custom objects to column values, and its support for mapping class hierarchies. It&#8217;s a long one today &#8211; 26 minutes &#8211; but a bit more focused. Enjoy.
