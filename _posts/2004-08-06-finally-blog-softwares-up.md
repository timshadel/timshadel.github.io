Well I&#8217;ve finally got Pebble 1.5 final installed. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, it&#8217;s not hard to install. I just can&#8217;t spell *contributor*, and it took a several different sessions over the course of a few weeks to notice my spelling error.

In general, I&#8217;m quite excited about Pebble. It&#8217;s pretty much everything I&#8217;ve wanted in blogging software for a while. Over the next few weeks I&#8217;ll be importing my blog entries from my local work Pebble installation, my Blogger.com run, and my ancient MoveableType installation. Hopefully I can actually find my backups!
