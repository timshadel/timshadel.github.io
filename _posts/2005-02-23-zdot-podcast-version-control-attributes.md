Download [Version Control Attributes][1].

This week is focused on version control.

#### Show Notes

Today&#8217;s show covered a few basic attributes important to using version control successfully with Java. The principles covered in [Software Configuration Management Patterns][2] are excellent. The two books from the [Pragmatic Programmer Bookshelf][3], on Subversion and CVS, are excellent references to the tools that tightly weave excellent principles into the book. There&#8217;s also great free book for [Subversion][4] &#8211; it&#8217;s mainly a tool reference, but excellent.
