We&#8217;ve been doing a bit of research lately on the &#8220;Buy vs. Build&#8221; argument in application development. As a survey of what&#8217;s out there, one of my colleagues collected a number of articles on the issue. Many of these are on the web, so you can check out [his Furl archive][1] in the [&#8220;Buy vs. Build&#8221; area][2]. If you&#8217;ve got any other sources, drop in a comment!
