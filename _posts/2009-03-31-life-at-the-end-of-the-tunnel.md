A couple months back I had a job change that took me out of state and brought my family back to where many of our extended family members live. We&#8217;ve been staying with my gracious in-laws for that time, looking for a place of our own. It looks like everything&#8217;s likely to go through at this point, and I&#8217;m optimistic that we may yet have all our stuff moved up and be able to establish familiar routines again.

That&#8217;s all to say that I&#8217;m hoping to have more time for blogging in the coming weeks. I&#8217;ve got some good stuff to share on a number of topics. Cya.
