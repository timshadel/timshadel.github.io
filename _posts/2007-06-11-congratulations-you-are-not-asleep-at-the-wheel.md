I&#8217;ve been using Safari 3 for Mac OS X for a couple hours, and while things seem generally nice so far (I love the expandable text areas, and it really is a very fast browser), it&#8217;s definitely a beta. I ran into a few odd screens, while trying to learn the shortcuts. Like this one:

![Safari Memory Debug Screen][1]

You can get this screen by hitting `Cmd + `. Now this screen seems to tell me that I can test how quickly a page loads, and also profile the memory used. I type in my URL and hit the right arrow button, just below &#8220;Start&#8221;, then hit the &#8220;Start&#8221; button.

When I do so, I get this message telling me about a memory leak:

![Safari memory leak message][2]

Now, **I don&#8217;t really think I found a memory leak**. I just think I don&#8217;t know how to run the test tool, the message is funny, and I think they probably forgot to yank it from the public beta.

In general, I&#8217;m stoked about fiddling with a new version of Safari. I started playing with browsers other than Firefox over a month ago.

A few behavioral oddities I&#8217;ve noticed include strange rendering of Google Analytics, and this conundrum where my resized text area &#8220;drag handle&#8221; ended up in a place that&#8217;s now unselectable &#8212; I can&#8217;t drag my text area to be smaller now.

[![Safari 3 Beta Bug: resizable drag handle isn't selectable.][3]][4]

I&#8217;m not worried though; they&#8217;ll fix it. But it sure is fun to play with beta software!
