I didn&#8217;t want to lose [this][1] link since the idea seems pretty cool to me. There are two major points: 1. Using a Knoppix CD you can boot onto most machines, including those in stores. USB keys might be used instead or as a supplement. 2. You may be able to use Knoppix to access a dead Windows drive, or even as a replacement to Ghost.

Anyway, there are some cool ideas there.
