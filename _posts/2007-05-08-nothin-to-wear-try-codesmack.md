> We are pleased to unveil to you, [codesmack.com][1], home of the funniest programmer t-shirts. We have over 15 different designs that can be paired with different shirt/color combinations to dress you out in style. Our designs try to bring humor to the IT world, promote good programing practices and add a little good natured smack talk to your wardrobe.
> 
> We welcome any feedback you have regarding the site design (treat it gently; it&#8217;s brand new), t-shirt ideas, or any other comments you would like to make. If you like a shirt, we won&#8217;t even complain if you buy one (or more).
> 
> Hope to see you in a CodeSmack t-shirt!

With this little announcement we let our family, friends, coworkers, and open source associates know what we&#8217;ve been up to for the month or so. We&#8217;ve got a great selection of designs started, with plenty more to come in time. Digg your favorites soon and you just might get a chance to pick one up at RailsConf.
