I just finished converting our Money class to extend a FixedPointValue class based on IBM&#8217;s BigDecimal. Hopefully this will prove a solid basis for fixed-point calculations involving financial data. Green bar on the former Money unit tests, decent JavaDoc for those who will extend FixedPointValue in the future. Extensions and heavy unit testing to come! <img src="http://timshadel.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" />
