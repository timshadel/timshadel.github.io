[CodeSmack: Announcing T-Shirt Tuesdays][1]

> 1. We will design new shirts and release them on Tuesdays  
> 2. We will sometimes feature existing t-shirt designs  
> 3. We will discount the t-shirts featured on Tuesday until the next Tuesday 

Head on over and see [this week&#8217;s newest designs and featured shirts][2], including one of my new favorite designs: *Ready. Fire. Aim.* <span style="font-size: 80%">(Hint: <a href="http://pcast.scribestudio.com/media_library_content/56930/9386/sound/Martin_Fowler_Keynote_Address.mp3">listen</a> to its inspiration from RailsConf 2006)</span> Buy &#8216;em this week and you&#8217;ll get a $2.00 discount over normal prices. Enjoy!
