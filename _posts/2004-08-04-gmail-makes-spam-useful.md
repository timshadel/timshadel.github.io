I never thought I&#8217;d like spam, but nowadays it&#8217;s occasionally useful. GMail is great at getting rid of unwanted spam, and I like that. Occasionally one gets through that advertizes a programming or web development related product. In these cases, GMail really shines. I simply click on the Google AdWords relevant to the spam to look at products that meet the same niche, but use legitimate advertising methods. Ah. GMail helps fill the product needs AND control spam. Lovely.
