&#8220;A triumph my dear, another triumph.&#8221; -[A Christmas Carol][2]

#### Show Notes

Eclipse 3.1 has some excellent new features. Chief among them for me is the JDK 1.5 support. They&#8217;ve got everything from enums to annotations supported, and done very well. Also of particular note is the first class support to the Rich Client Platform (RCP). Watch for the Web Tools Platform to finalize very soon as well.
