OK. I&#8217;m selfish. I want to know what GMail thinks of the various suggestions I&#8217;ve sent in. I want to know if I&#8217;m wrong, if I&#8217;m being ignored, or if I&#8217;m shelved while some really cool stuff happens first. I want to see what others have suggested, and vote for things I like.

So it&#8217;s official. The Open Source way of life has permanently corrupted me. I want deep information publicly accessible. I want to participate, and I want to see the group&#8217;s reaction to my input. I don&#8217;t care so much about [Google&#8217;s code][1]. I want [Google][2] to use [JIRA][3] in the Open.
