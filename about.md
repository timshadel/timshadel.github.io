I write software. I've done it on a bunch of different platforms, and in many
different languages over the years. Here you'll find a variety of posts
about topics mostly related to my family and programmingâ€”my two loves.

My wife, Jennifer, and I have 5 great kids. They're still pretty young, so
they occupy a lot of our time and attention.

I live in Utah, and work for [OC Tanner][octanner]. I'm also the developer
of [Waterlogged][waterlogged], a popular water tracking app for iOS.
